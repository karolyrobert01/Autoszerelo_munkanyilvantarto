# Auto Mechanic Work Tracker

The Auto Mechanic Work Tracker is a multi-component application that allows auto mechanics and their clients to efficiently track auto repair jobs and record them. The application is divided into three main parts:

## Client-Side

The client-side is a Blazor application that provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface for auto mechanics and clients. Here are some key features:

- **Task Recording**: Auto mechanics can add new repair tasks, including details and scheduled times.
- **Status Tracking**: They can monitor the status of the repair jobs, such as jobs that are in progress, completed, or pending.
- **Client Interaction**: Clients can access the tasks they've submitted and view their statuses.

## Server-Side

The server-side manages the database and the business logic of the application. Some primary functions include:

- **Database Management**: It stores and handles data related to auto repair tasks and clients.
- **User Management**: It facilitates user registration, login, and access control to the client-side.
- **Work Status Tracking**: It monitors the status of repair tasks and updates them.

## Common Web API

The Common Web API enables communication between the client and the server. Key services provided are:

- **API Endpoints**: Used for retrieving and updating data at endpoints that both clients and auto mechanics use.
- **Security**: The API ensures access control and secure communication.

The Auto Mechanic Work Tracker project aims to make auto mechanics' work more efficient and improve transparency and communication for clients. It is equally valuable for auto mechanics and clients to easily monitor and manage the car repair process.

**Please note that the project is currently not fully complete and is undergoing further development.**
